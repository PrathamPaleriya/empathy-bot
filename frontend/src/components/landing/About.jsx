        <p className="text-lg text-[#4f4f4f] mb-8">
          Built by a solo developer who wanted to create something that truly listens. EmpathyBot
          was born from a simple idea: everyone deserves to feel heard, understood, and emotionally
          supported.
        </p>

            "I created EmpathyBot because I believe emotional connection shouldn't be a luxury. In
            our busy world, we all need a safe space to express ourselves without fear of judgment."
