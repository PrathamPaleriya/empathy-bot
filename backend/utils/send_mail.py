    Hey there ðŸ‘‹,

    Welcome to EmpathyBot â€” a tiny safe space on the internet I'm building with all heart and no filters.

    EmpathyBot is more than just a project â€” it's something I've poured my heart into because I know what it's like to need a friend, especially when life feels overwhelming.

    âœ¨ What you can expect:
    - zero judgment, always support
    - chats that feel like 3AM convos
    - a bot that remembers you, not just your words
    - Your conversations are safe â€” I don't store exact chat history, so feel free to speak your mind without any worries. 

    Thanks for showing up. Seriously.
    Let's build something beautiful together ðŸ§¡

    â€” Pratham
    Just a guy who wants tech to feel more human

    P.S. If anything feels off or you've got ideas â€” just reply to this email. I read everything.

    Hey there,

    I noticed that you've decided to delete your EmpathyBot account, and while I completely respect your decision, I just want to take a moment to thank you for being a part of this journey.

    EmpathyBot was built with the intention of creating a space where you could feel heard, understood, and supported. If for any reason, it didn't meet your expectations or if you'd just like a break, I totally get it.

    That being said, if you ever decide to come back, I'll be here. And if you have any feedback or thoughts on how I can improve, I'd love to hear them. Your voice matters, even if you're not here right now.

    Take care, and remember, you're always welcome to return if you ever need that little bit of comfort again.

    Wishing you all the best ðŸ’›
